> **[If you want to change the world, pick up your pen and write"](https://www.jaquellecrowe.com/blog//2011/03/if-you-want-to-change-world-pick-up_14.html)**

Martin Luther once penned the quote above, "If you want to change the world, pick up your pen and write." But we prefer typing these days. But the goal remains the same 'Changing the world.’

Many times I ask myself a question - How can I make this world a better place? And one of the quickest responses I get is ‘by helping others’, and following up on how to achieve this, I get is ‘by sharing my knowledge and experiences.’ And I believe that the best way currently to do this is by **starting a blog**.

## Is there any other reason for starting this blog?

Yup, I am being a little selfish here 🫣 I think I can solidify my understanding of that topic by sharing some of my learnings here. This will help me think about a topic from a different perspective and ask questions that others can ask. As Albert Einstein said:

> **“If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.”**

One of the other benefits We’ll get is enriching our curiosity. From time to time, I’ll feel about writing about something new, and in doing so, We’ll learn about something new.

## What will you write about?

I can share what I am learning and how it is helping me in moving forward in my life. Currently, I am mostly thinking about writing on topics related to Programming & Design and sharing some bits of my learning in a more uncomplicated form which can be helpful for others.
