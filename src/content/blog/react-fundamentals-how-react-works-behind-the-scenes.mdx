In this post, I'll show you how I made my blog with Next.js and MDX.

You'll learn how to easily write long-form content with markdown and then give it superpowers with MDX.

You'll also learn about [static site generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) in Next.js and using [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).

First, let's go over what is markdown. Where might you use it? Then we'll bump it up a notch with MDX.

## What's good about markdown?

Markdown is a simple and lightweight markup language that adds formatting and other features to a plain text document. Being in plain text, this makes it convenient to add to version control software such as in a git repository.

In this way, we can avoid the need for having a content management system (CMS). It's portable and future-proof! No need to mess with any databases or third party software.

But why can't I just write my content in HTML or JSX? Well, you can. Nothing is stopping you. But if you were writing a blog post or some long-form content does this seem convenient?

```jsx
export default function MyPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Is this inconvenient?</h1>
      <h2>Has to be a better way</h2>
      <p>Shucks, now I have to wrap each paragraph in its own tags.</p>
      <p>
        And I'll also have to add <strong>importance like this</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And don't get me started with <a href='example.com/'>links</a>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

Let's look at how that might look in markdown instead:

```
# A simple header
## Isn't this nicer?
No more tags needed for paragraphs!
List em out:
- Strawberries
- Bananas
- Papaya
And I can say something **important like this**.
This is how we do [links](https://example.com).
```

Check out the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for more reference on the syntax of markdown. I won't cover them here, but just mention we can do all sorts of formatting, headings, lists, tables, and things like code blocks in markdown. And if you're looking to get some practice with markdown also try the [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

### ü¶∏ MDX: markdown with superpowers

That's a lot more comfortable than writing in JSX or HTML, but it's still a bit limiting though isn't it? What if I wanted to add a component to my markdown?

```
import { Chart } from "../components/chart";
# Is this possible?
It'd be nice to be able to render JSX components in my markdown!
<Chart description={description} />
```

Ah, but we can! We need markdown with superpowers. We need MDX! With MDX, you get the simplicity of markdown, but with the awesome flexibility to include JSX where we need it too.

## How to use MDX with Next.js

Sounds great, yea? Let's talk about how to put this into practice. I'll share with you how I made my blog with MDX and Next.js.

First of all, we have four options when it comes to using MDX in a Next.js project:

- [@next/mdx](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx)
- [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
- ~~next-mdx-enhanced~~
- [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)

The first is the officially supported option. If you want to go that route, there is a [good blog post about how to do that](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown). `next-mdx-remote` and `next-mdx-enhanced` are offered by HashiCorp, but only `next-mdx-remote` is still maintained. It will give you more control and options should you go that way.

I chose `mdx-bundler`, a project maintained by Kent C. Dodds. With `mdx-bundler` you get a MDX compiler and bundler, which distinguishes it from the other options. You can bundle at build time or run time. This capability makes it a suitable option for server-side rendering in addition to static site generation.

With `mdx-bundler`, your MDX source can come from the local filesystem, some other repository, or a remote content management system. It is also not tied to any one specific framework. In other words, it will work just fine with Next.js, Gatsby, Remix, Create React App, or any other React framework.

In my case, I'm bundling at build time from the local filesystem. I'm using Next.js's static site generation via `getStaticProps` and dynamic routes with `getStaticPaths`.

Actually, I've two good options here: static site generation or server-side rendering since `mdx-bundler` will work with either. If I had a lot of posts (perhaps one day), or my posts were being updated frequently, I'd consider using server-side rendering.

Even though projects like Next.js and Remix have made server-side rendering a high-performance option again, it's still hard to beat the reliability and speed that you get from static site generation. The tradeoff for static site generation is longer build times. The data will also be stale until next build, but for blog posts thats usually not a problem.

### üèóÔ∏è Building the foundation

My directory structure looks a bit like this:

```
jpreagan.com/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components # React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib        # Helper functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages      # Page routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ posts      # MDX content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public     # Static assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles     # CSS
```

Let's say I've all my posts in `*.mdx` files in the `/posts` directory. An individual post will look something like this:

```markdown
---
title: 'Starting a personal dashboard with the Spotify API'
date: '2022-09-08'
description: 'Use the Spotify API to start your own personal dashboard.'
---

My MDX content follows here...
```

Everything inside the `---` is referred to as the frontmatter. In a moment, I'll explain how to make use of this information in your code.

For now, let's make a new directory in the `/pages` directory: `/pages/blog`. And in that directory let's create a `/pages/blog/index.tsx` and a `/pages/blog/[slug].tsx`.

The index page is where I list all of the blog posts, and later as my posts grow, I'll have to paginate it too. The oddly named `/pages/blog/[slug].tsx` is like a template for an individual post.

By adding brackets `[ ]` to a route, we create a dynamic route. So now if I visit the URL `https://jpreagan.com/blog/`, it will take me to the index as expected. But if I visit `https://jpreagan.com/blog/not-a-page`, then I'll get a 404. This outcome should also be expected because that URL doesn't exist.

What we need here is `getStaticPaths`: that will allow us to define a list of paths to be statically generated. That list will come from our `/posts` directory: one for each of the filenames minus the `*.mdx` extension.
